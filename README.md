DEMO ðŸ‘‰ https://bear-sightings-kesvezbvdi.now.sh/

This is my solution to a coding challenge created by Dave.com as a part of their onboarding process.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your system.

## Setup

Get the code by either cloning this repository using git

    git clone https://github.com/luis-pena/bear-sightings.git

... or [downloading source code](https://github.com/luis-pena/bear-sightings/archive/master.zip) code as a zip archive.

Once downloaded, open the terminal in the project directory, and install dependencies with npm:

    npm install

Or with yarn

    yarn install

Then run the dev server script with npm:

    npm run dev

or with yarn

    yarn dev

The app should now be up and running at http://localhost:8080 ðŸš€
